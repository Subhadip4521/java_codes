Exception is an event that terminates the program abnormally
Exception handling in two ways (i) try catch (ii) throws
Types of exception (i) checked (ii) unchecked (not compiled by compiler) (iii) error
throws keyword is used to handover user created exception to caller method
throw keyword is used to handover user created exception to jvm
If a programmer wants to create exception object mandatorily or explicitly and handover/ give this exception object to the JVM then he/she should go for throw keyword.
If a method want to intimate about checked exception handling process to other method then we have to depend on throws keyword.
