Abstract method cannot be static as static methods should have a body and abstract methods should not.

Can an abstract class have static methods?

Yes, definitely can have as a static method is special flavor of concrete method. We know a static method can be called with object name (not possible here), class name and directly without the help of an object. Following program explains.

Java

abstract class Test
{
  public static void display()
  {
    System.out.println("Hello 1");
  }
}
public class Demo extends Test
{
  public static void main(String args[]) 
  {
    display();
    Test.display();
  }
}

abstract class Test
{
  public static void display()
  {
    System.out.println("Hello 1");
  }
}
public class Demo extends Test
{
  public static void main(String args[]) 
  {
    display();
    Test.display();
  }
}

Can an interface have static methods?

No, impossible. All methods of an interface must be public and abstract (by default takes also if not mentioned). As static methods should have a body, the interface methods cannot be static.
